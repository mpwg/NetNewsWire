# Reader

A native FreshRSS reader for macOS, iOS and iPadOS 27 or later, built with SwiftUI, SwiftData and Apple's Foundation Models. Each feed can show ordinary articles or a sourced daily digest. Originals stay accessible through feeds, search, stars and digest source links.

Open **Reader/Reader.xcodeproj** in Xcode 27 and select the shared **Reader** scheme. Use Xcode MCP for interactive project changes, builds and tests. The project was created with Apple's multiplatform template; no project, scheme or test-plan generator is used.

## Repository

- [Reader](Reader/README.md): native app, assets, unhosted code tests and the small native UI suite.
- [ReaderKit](ReaderKit/README.md): six libraries and the standalone SwiftData recovery probe.
- [Acceptance matrix](docs/reader/acceptance.md): criterion-specific evidence and outstanding product/platform work.
- [Continuation handoff](docs/reader/handoff-2026-10-24.md): current work and owner decisions.
- scripts/test-reader.sh and scripts/verify-reader-store.py: current CI orchestration.

The original NetNewsWire application, modules, extensions, assets, distribution tools and superseded Reader projects were removed on the owner's instruction. They remain recoverable in Git history. Only the native Reader project is an active application build entry point.

## Accounts and testing

Enable FreshRSS API access and set a separate API password. Enter the HTTPS server, username and API password in Reader. Debug uses eu.mpwg.reader.debug; Release uses eu.mpwg.reader, with separate stores and Keychain services. A development team and provisioning are needed for physical-device execution.

All code-testable app and runner behavior uses **Swift Testing** under Reader/ReaderTests. XCTest/XCUIAutomation is reserved for native window, sheet, keyboard, scrolling and rendering behavior. Most tests are code tests. Function identifiers use English lowerCamelCase; readable descriptions belong in @Test display names.

Every app, test and ReaderKit target enables Approachable Concurrency and compiler warnings as errors in Debug and Release. The shared scheme uses Apple's automatic test plan. CI first executes the Swift Testing runner contracts directly, then runs the native Reader plan and the process-recovery probe. Automatic coverage focuses on Mac; manual coverage: all retains Mac/iPhone/iPad validation for final acceptance.

Full product acceptance remains open. Real network-off/restart, final devices/iPad windows, accessibility, representative model/feed quality, PCC entitlement and distribution retain their explicit requirements. PCC is disabled in the normal build. See [umbrella #45](https://github.com/mpwg/NetNewsWire/issues/45) and [cleanup evidence](docs/reader/evidence/k-reader-only-2026-10-25.md).
